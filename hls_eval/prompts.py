## Task Description
Your task is to edit the given user's HLS code to prepare it for synthesis using Vitis HLS.
The code should be modified to ensure that it is synthesizable by the Vitis HLS tool.
                           
All C-style arrays need and array function arguments need to be declared and passed as fixed sized arrays.
For example `int* arr` should be converted to `int arr[SIZE]` and any functions that take `int* arr` as an argument should be changed to take `int arr[SIZE]` as an argument.
This also needs to be adapted for multi-dimensional arrays.
If any array dimension size parameters are needed for the fixed-size arrays, they should be defined as constants at the top of the file.
All arrays needed to have explicit sizes. For example, `int arr[]` should not be used; instead, use `int arr[SIZE]`.

There should be no recursion in the code; if so, refactor the code to remove recursion.
There should be no printf or sprintf statements in the code; if so, comment them out.
There should be no dynamic memory allocation in the code; if so, refactor the code to remove dynamic memory allocation and use fixed-size arrays.
There should be no usage of pointers, pointer dereferencing, or pointer arithmetic in the code; if so, refactor the code to remove pointers.

Floating-point data types and operations should be converted to fixed-point data types and operations when appropriate.
Please only do this conversion for `float` and double `types`.

All loops should have loop labels added to them using the `label: statement` syntax.
                           
Inserting Vitis HLS pragmas as needed (i.e. using `#pragma HLS ...`).

Please complete all the above steps to prepare the code for synthesis.
Do not over-optimize the code; the goal is to make the code synthesizable and slightly optimized as a starting point for further optimization.

You do not need to include any testbench code modifications in the output; these file (`*_tb.cpp`) should not be listed in the output.

When editing the provided HLS code, do not make new versions of the HLS kernels; edit the provided HLS kernels directly.
Edits should maintain consistency across the kernel, header, and testbench files. For example, changing function signatures and types in the kernel should be reflected in all places relevant in the code.

## Editing Task - Arbitrary Precision and Fixed-Point Types
Your task is to modify the given user's code to convert the usage of int and uint types to arbitrary precision HLS types, `ap_int`, `ap_uint`, as well as convert float and double types to fixed-point HLS types, `ap_fixed`, provided by Vitis HLS.

- int and uint types should be converted to the appropriate arbitrary precision types, `ap_int` and `ap_uint`.
- float and double types should be converted to the appropriate fixed-point types, `ap_fixed`.

The integer types are defined as follows:
    - `ap_int<W>`: Signed integer type with `W` bits
    - `ap_uint<W>`: Unsigned integer type with `W` bits
In order to use ap_(u)int types, the user needs to include the "ap_int.h" header file.
The individual bits in the ap_(u)int types can be indexed using the [] operator.
    You can also set and clear bits at specific indexes in the ap_(u)int types using the set and clear methods:
        - void ap_(u)int::set (unsigned i)
        - void ap_(u)int::clear (unsigned i)

The fixed point type is defined as follows:
    `ap_fixed<W, I>`
where:
    - `W`: Word length in bits
    - `I`: The number of bits used to represent the integer value, that is, the number of integer bits to the left of the binary point, including the sign bit.
In order to use fixed point types, the user needs to include the "ap_fixed.h" header file.
The fixed point type can handle most C++ arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and can be used in most C++ expressions.

If the user is also doing `cmath` operations on the original datatype numbers, these operations should be modified to use the HLS math library.
The HLS math library has the namespace `hls::*` and can be included with the following "hls_math.h" file. It supports most of the same math operators under the std::* namespace.

Typedefs for these new types are encouraged to make the code more readable.
Ideally, `typedef` statements should be placed in a header file so they can be reached by all source files.

The resulting code should maintain the same functionality as the original code but should convert all variants of int, uint, float, and double types to the appropriate arbitrary precision types.

prompt_dataflow = dedent(
    """
## Editing Task - Dataflow Semantics
Your task is to modify the given user's code to use "dataflow" semantics in the HLS kernel using the `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` pragma.
To use this pragma effectively, the code will need to be refactored into different subfunctions for computation tasks with intermediate producers and consumer variables.
Effectively, a dataflow function only contains calls to subfunctions as well as intermediate variables passed between the subfunctions.
The subfunctions must follow single-producer single-consumer rules, meaning that a variable / buffer can only be written to by one function and then only be read by one other function.
If data is needed for two subfunctions it needs to be duplicated.

The edited kernels must not have any of the following coding styles present in order to use dataflow semantics:
- Single-producer-consumer violations
- Feedback between tasks
- Conditional execution of tasks
- Loops with multiple exit conditions

In this case, if data needs to be buffered between tasks in a dataflow region, you may consider using fixed-sized arrays as buffers.

The resulting code should maintain the same functionality as the original code but should refactor the components into necessary dataflow subfunctions and use the DATAFLOW pragma in a manner which does not cause HLS synthesis to raise any dataflow violations.

    """
## Editing Task - Loop Tiling

Your task is to refactor the user's provided HLS kernel code by applying manual loop tiling source code transformations and inserting appropriate loop unrolling and array partitioning directives to optimize parallelism and memory access efficiency.

Specifically, you should:

- Manually tile loops into smaller blocks (tiles) with constant block sizes defined in the code to improve data locality and reduce memory bandwidth bottlenecks.

For a 2D example:

```
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        data[i][j] = ...;
        // loop body
    }
}
```

Should be transformed into:

```
const int N_TILE = 16;
const int M_TILE = 8;

#pragma HLS array_partition variable=data cyclic factor=N_TILE dim=1
#pragma HLS array_partition variable=data cyclic factor=M_TILE dim=2
<any more array partition pragmas needed for other variables>...

for(int i = 0; i < N; i += N_TILE) {
    for(int j = 0; j < M; j += M_TILE) {
        for(int ii = 0; ii < N_TILE; ii++) {
            #pragma HLS UNROLL
            for(int jj = 0; jj < M_TILE; jj++) {
                #pragma HLS UNROLL

                data[i + ii][j + jj] = ...;
                // loop body
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The same applies to 1D loops and n-D loops. Not all dimensions need to be tiled in every application.

- All loops must have fixed bounds and be perfect loops. Any other loop type is not allowed for tiling.
- The `#pragma HLS array_partition` pragma must be used if any arrays inside the loop are accessed using the tile indexes.
- Tiling with dependec on the outer loop is NOT allowed (ex. (ii = i; ii < i + N_TILE; ii++) is not allowed)
- Insert loop unrolling pragmas (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`) in the block loop of the loop tiling to minimize loop control overhead and maximize instruction-level parallelism.
- Be sure that the tiling factor is a constant value that is a factor of the loop trip count.
- If arrays are accessed using tile indexes, you must array partitioning pragmas (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION <type> factor=... dim=...`) to allow parallel access to array elements inside unrolled loop tiles.
    - <type> can be `block` or `cyclic`, `factor` is the partitioning factor, and `dim` is the dimension of the array to partition (indexing starting at 1).
    - If multiple dims are partitioned, each dim of the array needs a separate pragma statement.
    - `factor` can be set to a const or define value in the code.
- Ensure the transformed loops maintain the same functionality and do not introduce loop-carried dependencies or initiation interval (II) violations.

If loop tiling and unrolling optimizations are not applicable to the provided kernel code, leave the code unchanged.
