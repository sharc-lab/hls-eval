Kernel Description:
The `pixel_in_triangle` kernel is designed to determine whether a given pixel is inside a 2D triangle or not. This is a fundamental operation in computer graphics, particularly in rendering and ray tracing applications. The algorithm used in this kernel is based on the barycentric coordinate system, where a point is considered inside a triangle if the signs of the cross products between the point and the triangle's edges are all the same. The kernel takes the x and y coordinates of the pixel, as well as the coordinates of the triangle's vertices, as inputs. It calculates the cross products between the pixel and each edge of the triangle, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the pixel is inside the triangle.

The high-level dataflow of the design involves the following steps: 
1. Calculate the cross products between the pixel and each edge of the triangle using the formula: $pi = (x - x0) * (y1 - y0) - (y - y0) * (x1 - x0)$, where $(x0, y0)$ and $(x1, y1)$ are the coordinates of two consecutive vertices of the triangle.
2. Check the signs of the cross products. If all signs are the same (i.e., all positive or all negative), the pixel is considered inside the triangle.
3. Return a boolean value indicating whether the pixel is inside the triangle.

The architecture of the design is straightforward, with no complex control flow or data dependencies. The kernel is designed to be efficient and scalable, with a simple and regular dataflow that can be easily pipelined and parallelized.

Top-Level Function: `pixel_in_triangle`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`bit1 pixel_in_triangle(bit8 x, bit8 y, Triangle_2D triangle_2d);`

Inputs:
- `x`: The x-coordinate of the pixel, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer (`bit8`).
- `y`: The y-coordinate of the pixel, represented as an 8-bit unsigned integer (`bit8`).
- `triangle_2d`: A struct containing the coordinates of the triangle's vertices, represented as 8-bit unsigned integers (`bit8`). The struct has the following fields: `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `z`.

Outputs:
- `return value`: A boolean value indicating whether the pixel is inside the triangle, represented as a 1-bit unsigned integer (`bit1`).

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `Triangle_2D`: A struct representing a 2D triangle, with fields `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `z`, all of type `bit8`. The `z` field is not used in the current implementation.
- `bit1`: A 1-bit unsigned integer type, used to represent boolean values.
- `bit8`: An 8-bit unsigned integer type, used to represent the coordinates of the pixel and the triangle's vertices.
