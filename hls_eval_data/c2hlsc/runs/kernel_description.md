Kernel Description:
The Runs kernel is designed to analyze a binary sequence, represented by the epsilon array, and calculate two key statistics: the total number of ones in the sequence (S) and the total number of runs or changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 in the sequence (V). The epsilon array is a static array of size N (defined as 65535), where each element is either 0 or 1. The kernel iterates over the epsilon array, counting the number of ones to calculate S, and then iterates over the array again to count the number of changes between consecutive elements to calculate V. The results are returned through parameter references, allowing the caller to access the calculated values.

The algorithm used in the Runs kernel can be described as follows: 
- Initialize S to 0 and iterate over the epsilon array, incrementing S for each element that is 1.
- Initialize V to 1 (since a single element is considered a run) and iterate over the epsilon array starting from the second element, incrementing V for each element that is different from the previous one.
The kernel's functionality can be represented by the following equations:
- $S = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \epsilon[k]$
- $V = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (\epsilon[k] \oplus \epsilon[k-1])$

Top-Level Function: `Runs`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void Runs(int *res_S, int *res_V);`

Inputs:
- `res_S`: a pointer to an integer that will store the total number of ones in the epsilon sequence.
- `res_V`: a pointer to an integer that will store the total number of runs in the epsilon sequence.

Outputs:
- `res_S`: the total number of ones in the epsilon sequence, stored in the integer pointed to by res_S.
- `res_V`: the total number of runs in the epsilon sequence, stored in the integer pointed to by res_V.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `epsilon`: a static array of integers, where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the binary sequence to be analyzed.
