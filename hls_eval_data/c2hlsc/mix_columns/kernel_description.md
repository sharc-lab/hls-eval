Kernel Description:
The MixColumns kernel is a high-level synthesis design that represents the MixColumns step of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. The MixColumns step is a crucial component of the AES encryption process, responsible for mixing the columns of the state matrix to ensure the security and integrity of the encrypted data.

Top-Level Function: `MixColumns`
Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function: `void MixColumns(state_t *state);`

Inputs:
- `state`: a 4x4 matrix of 8-bit unsigned integers, representing the state matrix to be mixed.

Outputs:
- None

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `state_t`: a 2D array of 8-bit unsigned integers, representing the state matrix. The array has a size of 4x4, with each element being an 8-bit unsigned integer.

Sub-Components:
- `xtime`:
    - Signature: `uint8_t xtime(uint8_t x);`
    - Details: The `xtime` function is a simple bitwise operation that takes an 8-bit unsigned integer as input and returns the result of left-shifting the input by one bit and then XORing it with the result of right-shifting the input by 7 bits and multiplying the result by 0x1b.

The MixColumns kernel function takes a 4x4 state matrix as input and mixes its columns using the `xtime` function. The mixing process involves iterating over each column of the state matrix, performing a series of bitwise operations to mix the elements of the column, and storing the result back in the state matrix. The `xtime` function is used to perform the necessary bitwise operations to ensure the security and integrity of the encrypted data.

Note that the `MixColumns` function does not modify the original state matrix, but rather updates a copy of the state matrix stored in the `state` variable. This is because the `MixColumns` function is designed to be used as a component of a larger AES encryption algorithm, and the original state matrix needs to be preserved for further processing.
