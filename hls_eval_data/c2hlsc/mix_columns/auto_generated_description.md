Description:
The MixColumns kernel is a high-level synthesis (HLS) design that implements the MixColumns function from the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The MixColumns function is a critical component of the AES encryption process, responsible for mixing the columns of the state matrix to ensure the security and integrity of the encrypted data.

Top-Level Function: `MixColumns`
Complete Function Signature: `void MixColumns(state_t *state);`

Inputs:
- `state`: a 4x4 matrix of 8-bit unsigned integers, representing the state matrix to be mixed.

Outputs:
- None

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `state_t`: a 2D array of 8-bit unsigned integers, representing the state matrix.
- `uint8_t`: an 8-bit unsigned integer data type.

Sub-Components:
- `xtime`: a function that takes a single 8-bit unsigned integer as input and returns the result of applying the xtime operation to the input. The xtime operation is a bitwise left shift of the input by one bit position, followed by a bitwise XOR with the constant 0x1b if the most significant bit of the input is set.
- `Tmp`, `Tm`, and `t`: temporary variables used to store intermediate results during the execution of the MixColumns function.
