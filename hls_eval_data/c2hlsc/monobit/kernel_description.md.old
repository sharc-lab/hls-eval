Kernel Description:
The Frequency kernel is a high-level synthesis design that calculates the frequency of a binary sequence. The kernel takes an array of 0s and 1s as input and returns the frequency of 1s in the sequence. The frequency is calculated by summing up the values of the input array, where each value is either 0 or 2. The kernel uses a simple loop to iterate over the input array and accumulate the sum.

Top-Level Function: `Frequency`
Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function: `void Frequency(int *result);`

Inputs:
- `epsilon`: an array of 0s and 1s, representing the binary sequence, with a size of 128 elements.

Outputs:
- `result`: an integer representing the frequency of 1s in the input sequence.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `int`: a 32-bit signed integer, used to represent the frequency and array indices.
- `epsilon`: an array of 0s and 1s, with a size of 128 elements, used to represent the input binary sequence.

Sub-Components:
- `Frequency`:
    - Signature: `void Frequency(int *result);`
    - Details: The Frequency kernel iterates over the input array `epsilon` and accumulates the sum of the values. The sum is then stored in the output variable `result`. The kernel uses a simple loop to iterate over the input array, and the loop variable `i` is an integer that ranges from 0 to 127. The kernel also uses a local variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of the values.
