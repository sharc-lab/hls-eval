Description:
The Frequency kernel is a high-level synthesis design that calculates the frequency of a binary sequence. The kernel takes an array of 0s and 1s, `epsilon`, as input and returns the frequency of the sequence as an integer. The frequency is calculated by summing the values of the sequence, where each value is either 0 or 1, and then scaling the sum by a factor of 2.

Top-Level Function: `Frequency`
Complete Function Signature: `void Frequency(int *result);`

Inputs:
- `epsilon`: an array of 0s and 1s, with a length of `N`, where `N` is a constant defined in the `monobit.h` file. The array represents a binary sequence, where each element is either 0 or 1.

Outputs:
- `result`: an integer representing the frequency of the binary sequence.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `int`: a 32-bit signed integer data type used to represent the frequency of the binary sequence.
- `epsilon`: an array of 0s and 1s, with a length of `N`, where `N` is a constant defined in the `monobit.h` file. The array represents a binary sequence, where each element is either 0 or 1.

Sub-Components:
- `for loop`: a loop that iterates over the elements of the `epsilon` array, summing the values of the sequence. The loop is implemented using a C++ `for` statement and uses the `i` variable to index into the `epsilon` array.
- `sum calculation`: a calculation that sums the values of the sequence, where each value is either 0 or 1. The sum is calculated using the `sum` variable and the `+=` operator.
- `result assignment`: an assignment statement that assigns the calculated sum to the `result` variable.
