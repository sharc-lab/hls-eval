Kernel Description:
The `Frequency` kernel is designed to compute a statistical measure based on a binary sequence. Specifically, it calculates the sum of a transformed binary array `epsilon`, where each element of `epsilon` is either 0 or 1. The transformation applied to each element is `2 * epsilon[i] - 1`, which maps 0 to -1 and 1 to 1. The kernel then accumulates these transformed values to produce a single integer result. This result can be interpreted as a measure of the balance between 0s and 1s in the input sequence; a result close to 0 indicates a balanced sequence, while a result far from 0 indicates a sequence with a bias towards 0s or 1s.

Top-Level Function: `Frequency`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void Frequency(int *result, int epsilon[N]);`

Inputs:
- `result`: A pointer to an integer where the computed frequency result will be stored. The data type is `int`, and it is used to hold the final accumulated sum.
- `epsilon`: An array of integers of size `N` (128 in this case), where each element is either 0 or 1. The data type is `int`, and the array layout is a contiguous block of memory containing `N` integers.

Outputs:
- `result`: The computed frequency result is stored in the memory location pointed to by `result`. The result is an integer that represents the sum of the transformed values of the input array `epsilon`.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `epsilon`: An array of integers of size `N` (128). Each element is either 0 or 1, representing a binary sequence. The data type is `int`, and the array layout is a contiguous block of memory.

Sub-Components:
- None
