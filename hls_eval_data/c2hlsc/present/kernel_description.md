Kernel Description:
The PRESENT-80 encryption algorithm is a lightweight block cipher designed for resource-constrained devices. It operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a 80-bit key. The algorithm consists of 32 rounds, each comprising a substitution layer, a permutation layer, and a key addition layer. The substitution layer uses a 4-bit S-box to replace each nibble of the block, while the permutation layer rearranges the bits of the block. The key addition layer adds the round key to the block. The round keys are generated from the master key using a key schedule algorithm.

The key schedule algorithm generates 32 round keys from the 80-bit master key. It first copies the master key into the first round key, then applies a series of rotations, S-box substitutions, and XOR operations to generate the remaining round keys.

The encryption process starts by generating the round keys from the master key. Then, for each round, it adds the round key to the block, applies the substitution layer, and finally applies the permutation layer. After the last round, it adds the final round key to the block to produce the ciphertext.

The algorithm uses a number of constants and data structures, including the S-box, the master key, the round keys, and the block. The S-box is a 4-bit substitution table used in the substitution layer. The master key is the 80-bit key used to generate the round keys. The round keys are the 64-bit keys used in each round of the encryption process. The block is the 64-bit plaintext or ciphertext being encrypted or decrypted.

The algorithm can be mathematically represented using the following equations:

Let $P$ be the plaintext, $K$ be the master key, and $C$ be the ciphertext. Let $R_i$ be the $i$-th round key, and $B_i$ be the block after the $i$-th round.

The key schedule algorithm can be represented as:

$R_0 = K$

$R_i = \text{Rotate}(R_{i-1}) \oplus \text{S-box}(R_{i-1}) \oplus i$

The encryption process can be represented as:

$B_0 = P$

$B_i = \text{Substitution}(B_{i-1} \oplus R_i)$

$B_i = \text{Permutation}(B_i)$

$C = B_{31} \oplus R_{32}$

Where $\text{Rotate}$ is the rotation operation, $\text{S-box}$ is the S-box substitution, $\text{Substitution}$ is the substitution layer, and $\text{Permutation}$ is the permutation layer.
