Kernel Description:
The SHA-256 kernel is a cryptographic hash function that takes input data of any size and produces a fixed-size, 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. The kernel is designed to be secure, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to find two different input messages with the same hash value. The kernel uses a Merkle-Damg√•rd construction, which consists of a compression function and a message padding scheme. The compression function takes a 256-bit message block and a 256-bit state, and produces a new 256-bit state. The message padding scheme pads the input message to a multiple of the block size, and then appends a 64-bit representation of the message length.

The kernel uses a series of bitwise operations, including rotations, shifts, and XORs, to mix the input data and state. The kernel also uses a set of predefined constants, known as the round constants, which are used to introduce randomness into the hash value. The kernel iterates over the input data in 64-byte blocks, processing each block in a series of 64 rounds. In each round, the kernel performs a set of operations on the state and the current block of input data, using the round constants to introduce randomness.

The kernel also includes a finalization step, which pads the last block of input data and appends the message length. The finalization step ensures that the kernel produces a fixed-size hash value, regardless of the size of the input message.

The kernel uses the following equations to perform the compression function:
\[ t_1 = h + \Sigma_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + k_i + m_i \]
\[ t_2 = \Sigma_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c) \]
\[ h = g \]
\[ g = f \]
\[ f = e \]
\[ e = d + t_1 \]
\[ d = c \]
\[ c = b \]
\[ b = a \]
\[ a = t_1 + t_2 \]
where $h, g, f, e, d, c, b, a$ are the state variables, $k_i$ is the round constant, $m_i$ is the input message block, and $\Sigma_0, \Sigma_1, Ch, Maj$ are the bitwise operations.

The kernel also uses the following equations to perform the message padding:
\[ m = m || 0x80 || 0x00^{*} || l \]
where $m$ is the input message, $0x80$ is the padding byte, $0x00^{*}$ is the padding zeros, and $l$ is the message length.
