Kernel Description:
The BlockFrequency kernel is designed to calculate the block frequency test statistic, which is used to determine whether a sequence of bits is randomly distributed. The kernel takes an array of bits, epsilon, and calculates the sum of the squared differences between the proportion of ones in each block and the expected proportion of ones. The block size is defined by the constant M, and the number of blocks is defined by the constant N. The kernel uses a nested loop structure to iterate over each block and calculate the proportion of ones, then calculates the squared difference between this proportion and the expected proportion of ones, which is 0.5. The sum of these squared differences is then returned as the result.

The algorithm used in the kernel can be described by the following equation:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \epsilon[j + iM]}{M} - 0.5 \right)^2
$$

where $\epsilon$ is the array of bits, $N$ is the number of blocks, and $M$ is the block size.

The kernel uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the block frequency test statistic, making it efficient and easy to implement. However, the kernel assumes that the input array epsilon is already initialized with the sequence of bits to be tested, and that the constants N and M are defined correctly.

Top-Level Function: `BlockFrequency`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void BlockFrequency(double *result);`

Inputs:
- `result`: a pointer to a double-precision floating-point number that will store the calculated block frequency test statistic.

Outputs:
- `result`: the calculated block frequency test statistic, which is the sum of the squared differences between the proportion of ones in each block and the expected proportion of ones.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `epsilon`: a static array of integers, where each integer represents a bit (0 or 1) in the sequence to be tested. The array has a size of N * M, where N is the number of blocks and M is the block size.

Sub-Components:
- None
