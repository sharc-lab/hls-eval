Kernel Description:
The BlockFrequency kernel is a high-level synthesis design that calculates the frequency of blocks in a 2D array. The kernel takes an array of 0s and 1s as input and outputs a single value representing the frequency of blocks. The frequency is calculated by summing the squared differences between the probability of each block and 0.5.

Top-Level Function: `BlockFrequency`
Complete Function Signature: `void BlockFrequency(double *result);`

Inputs:
- `epsilon`: a 2D array of 0s and 1s with dimensions N x M, where N is 16 and M is 8. The array is initialized with values based on the remainder of the product of the row and column indices divided by 7.

Outputs:
- `result`: a single double-precision floating-point value representing the frequency of blocks.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `epsilon`: a 2D array of 0s and 1s with dimensions N x M, where N is 16 and M is 8. The array is represented as an integer array with values 0 or 1. The array is stored in column-major order.

Sub-Components:
- `BlockFrequency`:
    - Signature: `void BlockFrequency(double *result);`
    - Details: The kernel iterates over each block in the 2D array, calculates the probability of the block, and sums the squared differences between the probability and 0.5. The result is stored in the output variable `result`.
