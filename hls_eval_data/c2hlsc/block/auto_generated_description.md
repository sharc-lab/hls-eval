Description:
The BlockFrequency kernel is a high-level synthesis design that calculates the frequency of blocks in a 2D array of binary values. The kernel takes as input a 2D array of 0s and 1s, represented by the `epsilon` array, and outputs a single value representing the frequency of blocks with a sum of 1s that is different from 0.5.

Top-Level Function: `BlockFrequency`
Complete Function Signature: `void BlockFrequency(double *result);`

Inputs:
- `epsilon`: a 2D array of size `N x M` containing binary values (0s and 1s), where `N` is 16 and `M` is 8.

Outputs:
- `result`: a single double-precision floating-point value representing the frequency of blocks with a sum of 1s that is different from 0.5.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `double`: a double-precision floating-point data type used to represent the result.
- `int`: an integer data type used to represent indices and loop variables.
- `epsilon`: a 2D array of size `N x M` containing binary values (0s and 1s), where `N` is 16 and `M` is 8.

Sub-Components:
- The kernel consists of a single loop that iterates over the 2D array `epsilon`. For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the values in the current block, calculates the probability of the block being 0.5, and updates the result by adding the squared difference between the probability and 0.5.
