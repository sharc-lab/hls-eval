Kernel Description:
The stencil kernel is a high-level synthesis hardware design that implements a 2D stencil computation. The kernel applies a 3x3 filter to a 2D input array, producing a 2D output array. The computation is performed by iterating over the input array, applying the filter to each element and its neighbors, and accumulating the results to produce the output array. The kernel is designed to perform a single iteration of the stencil computation. The filter is a 1D array of 9 elements, and the input and output arrays are 2D arrays of size 128x64. The kernel uses four nested loops to perform the computation: two outer loops iterating over the rows and columns of the input array, and two inner loops iterating over the elements of the filter. The inner loops perform the stencil computation, accumulating the results in a temporary variable. The kernel uses a temporary variable to store the product of the filter element and the corresponding input element. The stencil computation can be represented by the following equation: 
\[ 
y[i, j] = \sum_{k1=0}^{2} \sum_{k2=0}^{2} x[i+k1, j+k2] \cdot f[k1, k2]
\]
where $y[i, j]$ is the output element at position $(i, j)$, $x[i+k1, j+k2]$ is the input element at position $(i+k1, j+k2)$, and $f[k1, k2]$ is the filter element at position $(k1, k2)$. The kernel is implemented using a simple and efficient architecture, with a focus on minimizing memory accesses and maximizing parallelism.

Top-Level Function: `stencil`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void stencil(int32_t orig[128 * 64], int32_t sol[128 * 64], int32_t filter[9]);`

Inputs:
- `orig`: a 2D array of `int32_t` elements, representing the input data, with a size of 128x64.
- `sol`: a 2D array of `int32_t` elements, representing the output data, with a size of 128x64.
- `filter`: a 1D array of `int32_t` elements, representing the 3x3 filter, with a size of 9.

Outputs:
- `sol`: the output 2D array, with the same size and data type as the input `sol` array.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `int32_t`: a 32-bit integer data type, used to represent the input and output data.
- `row_size` and `col_size`: constants defining the size of the input and output arrays, with values of 128 and 64, respectively.
- `f_size`: a constant defining the size of the filter array, with a value of 9.

Sub-Components:
- The kernel consists of four nested loops: two outer loops iterating over the rows and columns of the input array, and two inner loops iterating over the elements of the filter. The inner loops perform the stencil computation, accumulating the results in a temporary variable `temp`.
- The kernel uses a temporary variable `mul` to store the product of the filter element and the corresponding input element.
