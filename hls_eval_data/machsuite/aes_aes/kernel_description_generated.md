Kernel Description:
The AES-256 encryption kernel in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is a byte-oriented implementation that operates on individual bytes of the data and key. The design replaces all lookup tables with on-the-fly calculations, ensuring efficient and secure encryption. The kernel performs the encryption operation on a 16-byte block of data using a 256-bit key. The encryption process involves multiple rounds of substitution, shifting, mixing, and key addition, which are performed using various sub-components. The kernel uses the Galois field to calculate the S-box values, multiplicative inverses, and xtime values, which are essential for the encryption process. The kernel's architecture is designed to be parallelizable, allowing for efficient execution on various platforms.

The encryption process can be represented by the following equation:

$$C = E_{K}(P)$$

where $C$ is the ciphertext, $E_{K}$ is the encryption function with key $K$, and $P$ is the plaintext.

The kernel uses the following equations to calculate the S-box values and xtime values:

$$S(x) = \text{gf\_alog}(255 - \text{gf\_log}(x)) \oplus x$$

$$xtime(x) = (x \ll 1) \oplus (x \gg 7) \cdot 0x1b$$

where $S(x)$ is the S-box value for input $x$, $\text{gf\_alog}$ and $\text{gf\_log}$ are the anti-logarithm and logarithm functions in the Galois field, and $xtime(x)$ is the xtime value for input $x$.
