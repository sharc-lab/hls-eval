Kernel Description:
The local_sin kernel function is designed to calculate the sine of a given input angle in radians. This function utilizes the Taylor series expansion of the sine function to approximate the result. The Taylor series expansion of the sine function is given by the equation: 
\[
\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
\]
The kernel function implements this series expansion up to a certain precision, which is determined by the condition that the absolute value of the current term is greater than a specified threshold (0x3ee4f8b588e368f1ULL). The function iteratively calculates each term of the series and adds it to the running total until the condition is met.

The kernel function takes a single input, rad, which is the angle in radians for which the sine is to be calculated. The input is of type float64, which is an unsigned 64-bit integer representing the binary floating-point format.

The function uses several helper functions to perform the necessary calculations, including float64_mul, float64_div, and float64_add. These functions are used to perform the multiplications, divisions, and additions required by the Taylor series expansion.

The kernel function also uses several constants and thresholds to control the precision of the calculation and to handle special cases, such as NaN (Not a Number) and infinity.

Overall, the local_sin kernel function provides an efficient and accurate way to calculate the sine of a given angle in radians using the Taylor series expansion.
