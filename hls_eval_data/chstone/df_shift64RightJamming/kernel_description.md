Kernel Description:
The `shift64RightJamming` kernel performs a right shift operation on a 64-bit unsigned integer (`bits64`) by a specified number of bits (`int16`). The operation includes a jamming step, which means that if any bits are shifted out of the least significant bit (LSB) position, the result is set to 1 to indicate that data has been lost. This is particularly useful in floating-point arithmetic operations where precision is critical. The kernel handles three distinct cases based on the shift count: no shift, partial shift, and full shift (shifting by 64 bits or more).

The algorithm can be described as follows:
- If the shift count (`count`) is 0, the output is simply the input value (`a`).
- If the shift count is between 1 and 63, the output is the result of shifting `a` to the right by `count` bits, with the least significant bits filled by the logical OR of the bits that would have been shifted out. This is achieved by checking if any bits are set in the part of `a` that would be shifted out using the expression `((a << ((-count) & 63)) != 0)`.
- If the shift count is 64 or more, the output is 1 if `a` is non-zero, indicating that all bits have been shifted out and data has been lost, otherwise, the output is 0.

Top-Level Function: `shift64RightJamming`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void shift64RightJamming(bits64 a, int16 count, bits64 *zPtr);`

Inputs:
- `a`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the value to be shifted. The data type is `bits64`, which is an alias for `unsigned long long int`.
- `count`: A 16-bit signed integer representing the number of bits to shift `a` to the right. The data type is `int16`, which is an alias for `int`.

Outputs:
- `zPtr`: A pointer to a 64-bit unsigned integer where the result of the right shift and jamming operation will be stored. The data type is `bits64 *`, which is a pointer to `unsigned long long int`.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `bits64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type used to represent the input and output values. It is defined as `unsigned long long int`.
- `int8`: A signed 8-bit integer type used to represent the rounding mode and exception flags. It is defined as `int`.
- `int16`: A signed 16-bit integer type used to represent the shift count. It is defined as `int`.
