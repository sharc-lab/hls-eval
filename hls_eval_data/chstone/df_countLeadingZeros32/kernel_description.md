Kernel Description:
The `countLeadingZeros32` kernel is a high-level synthesis design that counts the number of leading zeros in a 32-bit unsigned integer. The design uses a combination of bitwise operations and table lookups to efficiently count the leading zeros. The algorithm works by shifting the input value to align the most significant bits with the table lookup index, and then using the table to determine the number of leading zeros.

Top-Level Function: `countLeadingZeros32`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`int8 countLeadingZeros32(bits32 a);`

Inputs:
- `a`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, represented as a `bits32` type, which is the input value to count the leading zeros.

Outputs:
- `shiftCount`: an 8-bit signed integer, represented as an `int8` type, which is the number of leading zeros in the input value.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `countLeadingZerosHigh`: a static constant array of 256 8-bit signed integers, which is used as a lookup table to determine the number of leading zeros in the high 8 bits of the input value.

Sub-Components:
- None
