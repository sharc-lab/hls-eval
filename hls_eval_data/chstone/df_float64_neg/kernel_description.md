Kernel Description:
The `float64_neg` kernel is designed to negate a 64-bit floating-point number represented as an unsigned 64-bit integer. The algorithm works by manipulating the bits of the floating-point number to change its sign. In IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format, the most significant bit (bit 63) represents the sign of the number. To negate the number, this bit is flipped while keeping the rest of the bits unchanged. This is achieved using bitwise operations. The kernel takes a 64-bit unsigned integer as input, which represents the floating-point number, and returns a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the negated floating-point number.

Top-Level Function: `float64_neg`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`float64 float64_neg(float64 x);`

Inputs:
- `x`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the floating-point number to be negated. The input is in IEEE 754 double-precision format.

Outputs:
- The function returns a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the negated floating-point number. The output is also in IEEE 754 double-precision format.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `float64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type used to represent the floating-point numbers. This type is defined in the header file `float64_neg.h`.

Sub-Components:
- None
