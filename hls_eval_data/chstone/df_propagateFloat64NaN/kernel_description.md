Kernel Description:
The `propagateFloat64NaN` kernel is designed to handle the propagation of NaN (Not a Number) values in double-precision floating-point arithmetic. The kernel takes two double-precision floating-point numbers as input and returns a double-precision floating-point number as output. The primary functionality is to determine which of the two input values should be propagated as the result, based on the NaN properties of the inputs. Specifically, the kernel prioritizes signaling NaNs over quiet NaNs, and among NaNs, it selects the one with the larger payload. If neither input is a NaN, the kernel returns the first input value.

The algorithm involves several steps:
1. **Check for NaN**: Determine if each input is a NaN by examining the exponent and fraction fields of the floating-point representation.
2. **Check for Signaling NaN**: Further classify NaNs into signaling and quiet NaNs by examining the payload bits.
3. **Propagate NaN**: Based on the classification, propagate the appropriate NaN value according to the rules:
   - If either input is a signaling NaN, propagate that input.
   - If both inputs are NaNs, propagate the one with the larger payload.
   - If neither input is a NaN, propagate the first input.

Top-Level Function: `propagateFloat64NaN`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`float64 propagateFloat64NaN(float64 a, float64 b);`

Inputs:
- `a`: A double-precision floating-point number represented as an unsigned 64-bit integer (`float64`).
- `b`: A double-precision floating-point number represented as an unsigned 64-bit integer (`float64`).

Outputs:
- The function returns a double-precision floating-point number (`float64`) which is the result of the NaN propagation logic.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `float64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type representing a double-precision floating-point number.
- `flag`: An integer type used to represent boolean flags (0 or 1).

Sub-Components:
- `float64_is_nan`:
    - Signature: `flag float64_is_nan(float64 a);`
    - Details: This function checks if the given `float64` value is a NaN by examining the exponent field. A value is considered a NaN if the exponent is all 1s and the fraction is non-zero.
- `float64_is_signaling_nan`:
    - Signature: `flag float64_is_signaling_nan(float64 a);`
    - Details: This function checks if the given `float64` value is a signaling NaN by examining the exponent and payload fields. A value is considered a signaling NaN if the exponent is all 1s, the payload is non-zero, and the most significant payload bit is 0.
