Kernel Description:
The `extractFloat64Exp` kernel is designed to extract the exponent part from a 64-bit floating-point number (IEEE 754 double precision format). The IEEE 754 double precision format represents a floating-point number using 64 bits: 1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the significand (mantissa). The exponent is stored in a biased form, where the bias value for double precision is 1023. The kernel performs a bitwise right shift to isolate the exponent bits and then applies a bitwise AND operation to mask out the unwanted bits, leaving only the 11-bit exponent value.

The kernel is implemented in a single C++ function, `extractFloat64Exp`, which takes a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the floating-point number and returns a 16-bit signed integer representing the extracted exponent. The function signature and implementation are straightforward, leveraging bitwise operations to achieve the desired result.

Top-Level Function: `extractFloat64Exp`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`int16 extractFloat64Exp(float64 a);`

Inputs:
- `a`: A 64-bit unsigned integer (`float64`) representing the IEEE 754 double precision floating-point number from which the exponent is to be extracted.

Outputs:
- The function returns a 16-bit signed integer (`int16`) representing the extracted exponent value.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `float64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type (`unsigned long long`) used to represent the IEEE 754 double precision floating-point number.
- `int16`: A signed 16-bit integer type (`int`) used to represent the extracted exponent value.

Sub-Components:
- None
