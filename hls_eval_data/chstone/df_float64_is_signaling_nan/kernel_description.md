Kernel Description:
The `float64_is_signaling_nan` kernel is designed to determine whether a given 64-bit floating-point number (IEEE 754 double precision) is a signaling NaN (Not a Number). A signaling NaN is a special value used to indicate an error or exceptional condition in floating-point computations. The kernel performs bitwise operations to inspect the exponent and fraction fields of the floating-point number to make this determination.

The IEEE 754 standard for double precision floating-point numbers specifies that a NaN is represented by an exponent field of all 1s (i.e., 0x7FF) and a non-zero fraction field. A signaling NaN is distinguished from a quiet NaN by having the most significant bit of the fraction field set to 0. The kernel checks these conditions to determine if the input number is a signaling NaN.

Top-Level Function: `float64_is_signaling_nan`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`flag float64_is_signaling_nan(float64 a);`

Inputs:
- `a`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing a double precision floating-point number in IEEE 754 format. The data type is `float64`, which is defined as `unsigned long long`.

Outputs:
- The function returns a `flag` indicating whether the input number is a signaling NaN. The `flag` data type is defined as `int`, where 1 represents true (signaling NaN) and 0 represents false (not a signaling NaN).

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `float64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type used to represent double precision floating-point numbers. It is defined as `unsigned long long`.
- `flag`: An integer type used to represent boolean flags, where 1 indicates true and 0 indicates false. It is defined as `int`.

Sub-Components:
- None
