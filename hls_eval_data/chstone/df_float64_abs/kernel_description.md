Kernel Description:
The `float64_abs` kernel is designed to compute the absolute value of a 64-bit floating-point number. The algorithm leverages the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision floating-point numbers, where the sign bit is the most significant bit (MSB) of the 64-bit representation. By masking out the sign bit, the kernel effectively returns the absolute value of the input number. The implementation uses bitwise operations to achieve this, ensuring efficient computation.

The IEEE 754 standard for double-precision floating-point numbers is represented as follows:
- 1 bit for the sign (S)
- 11 bits for the exponent (E)
- 52 bits for the fraction (F)

The absolute value of a floating-point number can be obtained by setting the sign bit to 0.
