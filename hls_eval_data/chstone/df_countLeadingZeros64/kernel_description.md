Kernel Description:
The `countLeadingZeros64` kernel is a high-level synthesis design that counts the number of leading zeros in a 64-bit unsigned integer. The design uses a combination of bitwise operations and table lookups to efficiently count the leading zeros. The kernel is divided into two main functions: `countLeadingZeros32` and `countLeadingZeros64`. The `countLeadingZeros32` function counts the leading zeros in a 32-bit unsigned integer, and the `countLeadingZeros64` function uses the `countLeadingZeros32` function to count the leading zeros in a 64-bit unsigned integer.

The `countLeadingZeros32` function uses a table lookup to count the leading zeros in the high 24 bits of the input. The table contains precomputed values for the number of leading zeros in each possible 24-bit value. The function then uses bitwise operations to shift the input and count the remaining leading zeros.

The `countLeadingZeros64` function uses the `countLeadingZeros32` function to count the leading zeros in the high 32 bits of the input. If the input is less than 2^32, the function shifts the input and adds 32 to the result. Otherwise, the function calls the `countLeadingZeros32` function to count the leading zeros in the high 32 bits and adds the result to the count.
