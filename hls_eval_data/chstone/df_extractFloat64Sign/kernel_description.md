Kernel Description:
The `extractFloat64Sign` kernel is designed to extract the sign bit from a 64-bit floating-point number (IEEE 754 double precision format). The sign bit is the most significant bit (MSB) of the 64-bit representation, where `0` indicates a positive number and `1` indicates a negative number.

Top-Level Function: `extractFloat64Sign`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`flag extractFloat64Sign(float64 a);`

Inputs:
- `a`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing a floating-point number in IEEE 754 double precision format. The data type is `float64`, which is defined as `unsigned long long` in the header file.

Outputs:
- The function returns a `flag` indicating the sign of the input floating-point number. The `flag` data type is defined as `int` in the header file, where `0` represents a positive number and `1` represents a negative number.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `float64`: An unsigned 64-bit integer type used to represent the input floating-point number. It is defined as `unsigned long long` in the header file.
- `flag`: An integer type used to represent the sign of the floating-point number. It is defined as `int` in the header file and can take values `0` or `1`.

Sub-Components:
- None
