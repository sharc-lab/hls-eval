Kernel Description:
The `merge_sort_parallel` kernel implements a parallel version of the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts those subarrays, and then merges them back together. In this parallel implementation, the merging process is performed in parallel stages, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of the hardware. The algorithm is designed to sort an array of `DTYPE` elements, where `DTYPE` is a floating-point type (`float`), and the size of the array is fixed at `SIZE` (16 elements in this case). The sorting process is divided into multiple stages, with each stage merging pairs of sorted subarrays of increasing width. The `merge_arrays` function is responsible for merging two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. The `merge_sort_parallel` function orchestrates the merging process across multiple stages, using a temporary array to store intermediate results.

The algorithm starts by merging adjacent pairs of elements (width = 1), then merges pairs of sorted subarrays of width 2, then width 4, and so on, until the entire array is sorted. The `merge_arrays` function uses a pipeline to process elements in parallel, with a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 1, meaning that a new element is processed every clock cycle. The temporary array `temp` is used to store intermediate results between stages, and it is partitioned completely along the first dimension to allow parallel access.

The design handles edge cases such as when the end of the array is reached during merging. In such cases, the function ensures that the remaining elements are correctly merged without accessing out-of-bounds memory. The algorithm is designed to be efficient in terms of both time and resource usage, making it suitable for hardware acceleration.

Top-Level Function: `merge_sort_parallel`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void merge_sort_parallel(DTYPE A[SIZE], DTYPE B[SIZE]);`

Inputs:
- `A`: An array of `DTYPE` elements (floats) of size `SIZE` (16 elements). This array contains the input data that needs to be sorted.
- `B`: An array of `DTYPE` elements (floats) of size `SIZE` (16 elements). This array is used to store the sorted output.

Outputs:
- `B`: The sorted array of `DTYPE` elements (floats) of size `SIZE` (16 elements). After the function execution, `B` contains the sorted elements from the input array `A`.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `DTYPE`: A floating-point data type (`float`) used to represent the elements of the input and output arrays.
- `SIZE`: A constant integer representing the size of the input and output arrays, set to 16.
- `STAGES`: A constant integer representing the number of stages in the merge sort process, set to 4.
- `temp`: A two-dimensional array of `DTYPE` elements used to store intermediate results between stages. The array has dimensions `(STAGES - 1) x SIZE` and is partitioned completely along the first dimension to allow parallel access.

Sub-Components:
- `merge_arrays`:
    - Signature: `void merge_arrays(DTYPE in[SIZE], int width, DTYPE out[SIZE]);`
    - Details: The `merge_arrays` function merges two sorted subarrays of width `width` from the input array `in` into a single sorted array stored in the output array `out`. The function uses a pipeline to process elements in parallel, with a pipeline initiation interval (II) of 1. It handles edge cases such as when the end of the array is reached during merging, ensuring that the remaining elements are correctly merged without accessing out-of-bounds memory.
