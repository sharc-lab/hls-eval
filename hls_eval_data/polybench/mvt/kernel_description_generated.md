Kernel Description:
The `kernel_mvt` design is a high-level synthesis kernel that performs a matrix-vector multiplication (MVT) composed with another MVT but with a transposed matrix. The kernel takes five inputs: two vectors `y1` and `y2` of length `N`, and a square matrix `A` of size `N x N`. The kernel outputs two vectors `x1` and `x2` of length `N`, where `x1` is the result of the MVT of `A` and `y1`, and `x2` is the result of the MVT of the transposed matrix `A` and `y2`.

It takes the following as inputs,

- $A: N \times N$ matrix
- $y1, y2$: vectors of length $N$

and gives the following as outputs:

- $x1$: vector of length $N$, where $x1 = x1 + Ay1$
- $x2$: vector of length $N$, where $x2 = x2 + A^Ty2$

Top-Level Function: `kernel_mvt`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void kernel_mvt(double x1[40], double x2[40], double y_1[40], double y_2[40], double A[40][40]);`

Inputs:
- `x1`: an input vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that will be updated with the result of the MVT of `A` and `y1`.
- `x2`: an input vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that will be updated with the result of the MVT of the transposed matrix `A` and `y2`.
- `y_1`: an input vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that is one of the operands of the MVT.
- `y_2`: an input vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that is one of the operands of the MVT.
- `A`: an input square matrix of size `N x N` (40 x 40 in this implementation) that is one of the operands of the MVT.

Outputs:
- `x1`: an output vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that is the result of the MVT of `A` and `y1`.
- `x2`: an output vector of length `N` (40 in this implementation) that is the result of the MVT of the transposed matrix `A` and `y2`.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `double`: a 64-bit floating-point data type used to represent the elements of the input vectors and matrix.
