Kernel Description:
The `kernel_trisolv` is a high-level synthesis hardware design that implements a triangular matrix solver using forward substitution. It takes a lower triangular matrix `L` and a vector `b` as inputs and produces a vector `x` as output, where `Lx = b`. The forward substitution is performed using the equation `x(i) = (b(i) - âˆ‘[j=0 to i-1] L(i, j) \* x(j)) / L(i, i)`. The design uses a nested loop structure to iterate over the elements of the matrix and vector, performing the necessary computations to solve for `x`.

It takes the following as inputs,

- $L$: $N \times N$ lower triangular matrix
- $b$: vector of length $N$

and gives the following as output:

- $x$: vector of length $N$, where $Lx = b$

The forward substitution is as follows:

$$
x(i) = \frac{b(i) - \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} L(i, j) \cdot x(j)}{L(i, i)}
$$
