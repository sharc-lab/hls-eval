Kernel Description:
The `kernel_seidel_2d` design is an implementation of a Gauss-Seidel style stencil computation over 2D data with a 9-point stencil pattern. The algorithm iteratively updates each element of a 2D array `A` using the average of its nine neighboring elements from the previous time step. The computation is simplified as a stencil operation, where each element is updated using the values of its neighbors.

$$
\begin{aligned}
data^{t}_{(i,j)} = \frac{1}{9} \big(
& data^{t-1}_{(i-1,j-1)} + data^{t-1}_{(i-1,j)} + data^{t-1}_{(i-1,j+1)} \\
& + data^{t-1}_{(i,j-1)} + data^{t}_{(i,j)} + data^{t-1}_{(i,j+1)} \\
& + data^{t-1}_{(i+1,j-1)} + data^{t-1}_{(i+1,j)} + data^{t-1}_{(i+1,j+1)}
\big)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the design assumes a fixed size of 40x40 for the 2D array `A`, and the number of time steps is fixed at 20. These constants can be modified to accommodate different problem sizes and time steps.
