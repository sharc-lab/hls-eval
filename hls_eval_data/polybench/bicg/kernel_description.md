Kernel Description:
The kernel_bicg is an implementation of the BiConjugate Gradient STABilized method (BiCGSTAB) kernel. It takes a matrix A, vectors p and r as inputs, and produces vectors q and s as outputs. The kernel performs two main operations: computing q = Ap and s = A^Tr. The BiCGSTAB method is an iterative method for solving systems of linear equations, and this kernel is a key component of the algorithm.

It takes the following as inputs,

- $A: N \times M$ matrix
- $p$: vector of length $M$
- $r$: vector of length $N$

and gives the following as output:

- $q$: vector of length $N$, where $q = Ap$
- $s$: vector of length $M$, where $s = A^Tr$
