Kernel Description:
The `kernel_atax` design is a high-level synthesis kernel that computes the matrix-vector product of a transposed matrix `A` with a vector `x`, and then computes the matrix-vector product of the original matrix `A` with the resulting vector. This is equivalent to computing `A^T(Ax)`, where `A^T` is the transpose of matrix `A`. The kernel takes in a matrix `A` and a vector `x` as inputs, and produces a vector `y` as output.

Computes $A^T$ times $Ax$.
It takes the following as inputs,

- $A: M \times N$ matrix
- $x$: vector of length $N$

and gives the following as output:

- $y$: vector of length $N$, where $y = A^T(Ax)$

Top-Level Function: `kernel_atax`

Complete Function Signature of the Top-Level Function:
`void kernel_atax(double A[38][42], double x[42], double y[42], double tmp[38]);`

Inputs:
- `A`: a 2D matrix of size 38x42, where each element is a `double` precision floating-point number.
- `x`: a 1D vector of length 42, where each element is a `double` precision floating-point number.

Outputs:
- `y`: a 1D vector of length 42, where each element is a `double` precision floating-point number, representing the result of the computation `A^T(Ax)`.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `double`: a `double` precision floating-point number, used to represent the elements of the matrix `A` and vectors `x` and `y`.
- `tmp`: a 1D vector of length 38, used as a temporary storage for intermediate results.

Sub-Components:
- None

Note: The kernel uses a temporary vector `tmp` to store intermediate results, which is necessary to avoid overwriting the input vector `x` during the computation.
