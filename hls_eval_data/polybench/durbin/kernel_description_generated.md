Kernel Description:
The Durbin kernel is an algorithm for solving Yule-Walker equations, which is a special case of Toeplitz systems. It takes a vector `r` of length `N` as input and produces a vector `y` of length `N` as output, such that `Ty = -r` where `T` is a symmetric, unit-diagonal, Toeplitz matrix defined by the vector `[1, r_0, ..., r_{N-1}]`. The algorithm is a direct implementation of the Durbin algorithm described in a book by Golub and Van Loan.

It takes the following as input,

- $r$: vector of length $N$.

and gives the following as output:

- $y$: vector of length $N$

such that $Ty = -r$ where $T$ is a symmetric, unit-diagonal, Toeplitz matrix defined by the vector $[1,r_0, \ldots ,r_{N-1}]$.
The C reference implementation is a direct implementation of the algorithm described in a book by Golub and Van Loan. The book mentions that a vector can be removed to use less space, but the implementation retains this vector.
